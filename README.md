## MPD Pi Bridge

### Setup

Clone the repo onto the Pi, then run:

```bash
make setup
```

This installs system packages, creates the virtualenv, installs dependencies, registers and starts the systemd service.

### Service Commands

```bash
make update   # git pull + install deps + restart
make restart  # restart the service
make start    # start the service
make stop     # stop the service
make status   # show service status
make logs     # tail service logs
```

## Usage

Access the API via the pi's hostname, for example raspberrypi.local.

View the available routes at http://{hostname}.local:8000/docs

Send a post to the available endpoints. For example, to play the queue:

```bash
curl -X POST http://{hostname}.local:8000/play
```
